# RoBLARK_evaluation
This repository contains scripts used for evaluating Romanian Basic Language Processing Kits (BLARK) tools.

For properly using the scripts, in the top folder there must be a subfolder corresponding to each of the tools and a "ud" folder with the current UD tree. 
The tools folders are: "NLP-Cube", "RNNTagger", "TreeTagger", "stanza", "udpipe-1.2.0".
Each tool may require specific python packages (according to the documentation) therefore additional virtual evns are indicated for each such tool.
